        <h2>About <a href="https://hackclub.com/">Hack Club</a></h2>
    </center>

    <p>Learning to code gives you super powers, and Hack Club is built to be a fun home for high schoolers interested in technology, where they can meet friends, build amazing things with code and be part of a culture that is wholesome, kind, curious and oriented towards problem solving. </p>
    
    <p>Hack Club was founded by then teenager Zach Latta, and the average age of staff is about 22. We are a network of after school computer science clubs and a Slack network for teenagers who love technology and building with code.  We are currently a remote team of 7, and excited about growing the team as more and more students join our Slack and start clubs. </p>
 
    <p>Hack Club doesn't have teachers or offices. Most of what we do is student led.  Currently, Hack Club has nearly 500 computer science clubs around the country and world started by students in their own high schools, from Kentucky to Long Island to San Francisco, Kerala, India and Kenya. 
   10,000 students are on our Slack; and more than 100 CS events like hackathons (now virtual) happen each year. </p>

    <p>  We've created a space where students want to learn to build cool stuff that interests them with their friends- and they get hooked into the beauty and excitement of building with technology, and become self taught.Everything at Hack Club is free and open source (3,300 commits at GitHub), including our code and our financing. </p> 
    
    <p> In 5 years, we hope Hack Club will have helped create a new generation of leaders with 21st century skills, as well
        as a mindset that values kindness, optimism, fun, creativity and passion for building great things that push
        progress.</p>
