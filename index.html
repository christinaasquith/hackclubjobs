        <h2>About <a href="https://hackclub.com/">Hack Club</a></h2>
    </center>

    <p>Hack Club is a network of the most technically talented teenagers in the US and world. Everything at Hack Club is
        free and open source (3,300 commits at GitHub), including our code and our financing. Check out "transparency
        mode" at Hack Club Bank (we built this) which lets the public see our salaries and all our spending.</p>

    <p>Hack Club was founded in 2014 by Zach Latta, then a 16 year old programmer and high school dropout, and it's grown to a team of 8, including programmers, journalists and students. Currently, Hack Club has nearly 500 computer science clubs around the country and world started by students in their own high schools, from Kentucky to Long Island to San Francisco, Kerala, India and Kenya.  
    </p>

    <p>10,000 students are on our Slack; and more than 100 CS events like hackathons (now virtual) happen each year. In
        5 years, we hope Hack Club will have helped create a new generation of leaders with 21st century skills, as well
        as a mindset that values kindness, optimism, fun, creativity and passion for building great things that push
        progress.</p>

    <p>  We've created a space where students want to learn to build cool stuff that interests them with their friends- and they get hooked into the beauty and excitement of building with technology, and become self taught. </p>
