    <p>
    Learning to code gives you super powers and Hack Club, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, is built to be a fun home for high schoolers interested in technology. In Hack Club, teenagers meet friends, build amazing things with code, and become part of a culture that is wholesome, kind, curious, and oriented towards problem solving.
    </p>

    <p>
    Hack Club was founded by then teenager Zach Latta and the average age of staff is about 22. We are a network of after-school computer science clubs and a Slack network for teenagers who love technology and building with code. We are currently a remote team of 7 and excited about growing the team as more and more students join our Slack and start clubs.
    </p>

    <p>
    Hack Club doesn't have teachers or offices. Most of what we do is student-led. Currently, Hack Club has nearly 500 computer science clubs around the country and world started by students in their own high schools, from Kentucky to Long Island to San Francisco, Kerala, India, Kenya, and Zambia. 10,000 students are on our Slack; and more than 100 CS events (hackathons, now virtual) happen each year.
    </p>

    <p>
    We've created a space where students want to learn to build cool stuff that interests them with their friends and they get hooked into the beauty and excitement of building with technology, eventually becoming self-taught. Everything at Hack Club is free and open source (3,300 commits on GitHub), including our code and our finances.
    </p>

    <p>
    In 5 years, we hope Hack Club will have helped create a new generation of leaders with 21st century skills, as well as a mindset that values kindness, optimism, fun, creativity, and passion for building great things that push progress.

	<b>Job description:</b>
	</p>

	<p>
	Running <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a> is already a big job and this school year, we're trying to support more students launching more Hack Clubs. We need an awesome assistant who is organized, entrepreneurial, and cheerful. You don't need to be highly technical for this role.
	</p>

	<p>
	If you're great at logistics, extremely organized, highly motivated to volunteer for projects, and able to anticipate problems and show initiative in solving them, then you're just what we need in this position.
	</p>

	<p>
	As your first priority, you will be responsible for scheduling group calls between students and staff members. Hack Club operates in nearly all 50 states and 22 countries worldwide, meaning you must be comfortable with complicated scheduling challenges across many different timezones.
	</p>

	<p>
	Given the inevitable chaos this school year will bring, you must be ready to pick up projects when gaps are found. These may include, but are not limited to: mailing handwritten notes to students, receiving laptops in the mail and shipping them to students, joining calls to take notes, and thoughtfully reminding staff to check in with students.
	</p>

	<p>
	If you're interested, please submit 3-5 short paragraphs detailing your background, education, location, whether you've worked remotely before, the word "elephant" in the subject line, and why you think you're a good fit for this job to assistant@hackclub.com.
	</p>

	<p>
	You'll likely become more technical and you'll be rewarded not only in salary, but also in the secret knowledge that everything would fall apart without you.
	</p>

	<p>
	Requirements:
	</p>

	<ul>
	<li>Extremely organized</li>
	<li>Ready to follow up with students if they don't respond, both over email and text</li>
	<li>Perfect English and grammar</li>
	<li>Great attitude, cheerful and bringing a can-do mindset to work</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	Nice to haves:
	</p>

	<ul>
	<li>Great handwriting</li>
	<li>Experience leading a club when you were in high school or college (it's OK if that was decades ago!)</li>
	</ul>
